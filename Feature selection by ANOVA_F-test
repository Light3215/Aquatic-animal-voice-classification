Here's a basic example of how you can perform feature selection for audio classification using a filter method, specifically using the ANOVA F-test score, which is commonly used for feature selection when dealing with classification tasks:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Example dataset (replace with your audio data)
X, y = load_digits(return_X_y=True)

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature selection using ANOVA F-test
selector = SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=20)  # Select top 20 features
X_train_selected = selector.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
X_test_selected = selector.transform(X_test)

# Train classifier on selected features
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train_selected, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_selected)

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

In this example:
- We load an example dataset (digits dataset from scikit-learn) as a placeholder for your audio data.
- We split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- We use `SelectKBest` from scikit-learn with the ANOVA F-test (`f_classif`) as the score function to select the top 20 features.
- We transform both the training and testing data to contain only the selected features.
- We train a RandomForestClassifier on the selected features.
- We evaluate the accuracy of the classifier on the testing set.

Replace `X` and `y` with your audio features and labels, respectively. You may need to extract relevant features from your audio data first using methods such as MFCCs, spectral features, or statistical features, as mentioned earlier.

Feel free to adjust the parameters, such as the number of features (`k`), the classification algorithm, or the evaluation metric, based on your specific requirements and the nature of your audio classification task.
